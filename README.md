- **Update Borrower Information**: Update borrower information when required, such as contact details.
- **Remove Borrowers**: Remove borrowers from the system if necessary.

### Book Borrowing and Returning
- **Borrow Books**: Allow borrowers to borrow books by linking the borrower's membership ID to the book details and recording the due date.
- **Return Books**: Implement a mechanism for borrowers to return books, updating the database accordingly.

### Book Search and Availability
